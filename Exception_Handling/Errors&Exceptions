Exceptions can occur:
Opening a file and it doesn't exist
Taking user input but user doesnt give any
Trying to run a process but CPU isn't available
Divide by 0


Main Class: Throwable Class
Subclasses: Exceptions; Errors

Exceptions can be handled 
Errors cannot be handled

Errors:
JVM not working properly
RAM going out of memory

Exceptions : Checked- IOExceptions;SQL Exceptions ; Unchecked- RunTime Exceptions ->ArithmeticExceptions

Statements: normal eg- int i=1 ; critical eg- double k = i/j -> Here j could be zero

Handling critical statements: Write them inside blocks

try{
    double k = i/j;
}
catch(ArithmeticException ae){
    "Some Code"
}
//One try can have multiple catch blocks
try{
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("abc.txt");
}
catch(ArithmeticException ae){
    "Some Code"
}
catch(IOException ie){
    "Code"
}

What if we do not know the type of exception- Write a general exception: since Exception class contains all the exception subclasses

catch(Exception e){
    //Handles all type of exceptions
}
